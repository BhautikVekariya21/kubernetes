## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps manage containers across multiple hosts, providing high availability, scaling, and efficient resource usage. Kubernetes abstracts the infrastructure, allowing you to deploy and manage applications in a consistent manner across any environment, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

Key components of Kubernetes include:
- **Nodes**: These are the worker machines that run your containerized applications.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers.
- **Services**: Provide a stable endpoint to connect to a set of pods, enabling load balancing.
- **Deployments**: Manage and automate the lifecycle of applications, allowing you to scale and update them with ease.

## History of Kubernetes

Kubernetes was born out of Google's extensive experience managing containerized workloads at scale. In the early 2000s, Google developed an internal platform called **Borg** to orchestrate millions of containers every day. In 2014, Google released Kubernetes as an open-source project, inspired by Borg but adapted for wider industry use. Kubernetes is now governed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and has grown to become the leading container orchestration platform, thanks to a large and active community.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes has a master-worker architecture designed for reliability, scalability, and extensibility. Here's a breakdown of its main components:

- **Control Plane (Master Components)**:
  - **API Server**: The front end of the Kubernetes control plane, handling requests from the `kubectl` CLI or other components.
  - **etcd**: A key-value store that stores cluster data. Itâ€™s the source of truth for the clusterâ€™s state.
  - **Scheduler**: Assigns work to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
  - **Controller Manager**: Runs background processes to manage cluster state (e.g., ensuring a desired number of replicas).

- **Node Components (Worker Nodes)**:
  - **Kubelet**: An agent running on each node that ensures containers are running as expected.
  - **Kube Proxy**: Manages network routing for services and pods.
  - **Container Runtime**: The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

Together, these components ensure that your applications are deployed, scaled, and maintained in the desired state.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this crash course, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

### Docker
Docker is required to build and run containers locally. Docker serves as the container runtime for Kubernetes and enables you to package applications and dependencies into a single image.

### kubectl
`kubectl` is the Kubernetes command-line tool that allows you to interact with the Kubernetes API server. With `kubectl`, you can deploy, update, and manage resources in the Kubernetes cluster. To install `kubectl`, refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

### Minikube
Minikube is a local Kubernetes setup that allows you to create a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine. It is ideal for learning and development as it simulates a full cluster environment on a single node. To set up Minikube, follow the [Minikube installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Make sure you have a basic understanding of containers, Docker, and command-line operations before starting.

## Project Details

In this Kubernetes crash course project, weâ€™ll explore:
1. Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube and using `kubectl` to interact with it.
2. Deploying and managing core Kubernetes resources like **Pods**, **Services**, and **Deployments**.
3. Configuring advanced Kubernetes features such as **Secrets** and **ConfigMaps** for managing sensitive data.
4. Monitoring and scaling applications based on resource usage.

This project is structured to build foundational skills and progress toward more advanced configurations, providing you with the skills needed to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications.

### Repository Details
The repository contains YAML files for setting up Kubernetes resources, example applications, and troubleshooting tips. Youâ€™ll also find helpful scripts for managing the Kubernetes cluster and practicing key concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and follow along with each section of the crash course.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BhautikVekariya21/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
```

Ensure you have Docker, kubectl, and Minikube installed as per the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
